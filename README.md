## INTRODUCTION.
In the competitive landscape of online retail, understanding customer behavior is crucial for driving growth, increasing retention, and improving marketing strategies. Cohort analysis offers a powerful lens through which businesses can track and compare groups of customers (cohorts) based on shared characteristicsâ€”most commonly the time of their first purchase.

This project focuses on performing a cohort analysis of online retail customers, grouped by the month of their first transaction. The objective is to evaluate customer retention trends, repeat purchase behavior, and lifetime value over time. By analyzing how different cohorts behave after their initial interaction with the platform, we can uncover insights that inform customer engagement strategies, promotional timing, and product recommendations.
